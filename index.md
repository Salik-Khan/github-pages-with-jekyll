I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my future and my studies. I have a lot to study these days but I can't figure out what shoulde I do first. There are many sites that are helping me learn new skills and also renew plus practice the old ones. Some of these sites are digiskills.pk, khanacademy.org and also lab.github.com itself! I study almost 4 hours everyday but sometimes I gat easily distracted. But, I dont know why I have problems deciding my future.
